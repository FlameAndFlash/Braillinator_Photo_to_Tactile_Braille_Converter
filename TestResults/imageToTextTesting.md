# OCR Conversion Results
The conversion results are highly variable, with some images showing near-perfect text recognition, while others produce a string of nonsensical characters. When evaluated subjectively, the recognition is generally accurate, with over 75% of the text passing the autocorrect checker in most test cases. The only exception is Image 1, which is notably unreadable due to blurriness. All other images meet the 25% error threshold. A closer analysis reveals that inaccuracies often occur in areas where the text is unclear, such as shadows, tilts, or distortions. Overall, the algorithm performs well and can be considered a reasonable success.

And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs. For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune.

Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on i- ther side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly. Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes. From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also. Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.“ There’ s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife.“ T’ ll go look after the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept. Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the danger close at hand.“ Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed.“ Run for the cell- lar!” Toto jumped out of Dorothy’ s arms and hid under ar 3& |

Birds flew in quiet formation, heading home as the evening grew cooler. The air smelled fresh, with a hint of pine from the nearby trees. On the ground, the grass rustled gently in the breeze. and people were starting to gather in the park, enjoying the last moments of daylight. It was the kind of evening that made you pause and appreciate the quiet moments in life. The small town was quiet in the early coming light. Streets were empty, except for a few birds hopping from sidewalk to sidewalk, pecking at crumbs. The old bakery on the comer was Just opening, and a waft of freshly baked bread filled the air. People slowly began to stir in their homes, and the day started to take shape. It was one of those peaceful comings when nothing seemed urgent, and everything felt calm and content.

The sand was warm beneath her( get, and the sound of seagulls echoed in the distance. She breathed in deeply, letting the salty air fill her lungs. For a moment, she closed her eyes and felt completely at peace, as though the world was on pause, allowing her to just be. As the train rumbled down the tracks, the landscape outside the window began to change. The flat fields gave way to rolling hills, covered in patches of wildflowers. The sky above was a soft blue, with a few fluffy clouds drifting lazily by. Inside the train, passengers were lost in their thoughts, the hum of the wheels on the track the only sound filling the air. It was a quiet journey, a me to reflect and watch the world pass by. In the heart of the city, the park was a rare patch of green amidst the concrete. Tall trees lined the paths, their branches swaying gently in the breeze. Children ran and played, their laughter filling the air, while people sat on benches, lost in books or conversation The fountain in the center bubbled happily, sending little droplets of water into the air. It was a place where time slowed down, and for a few hours, the hustle of the city seemed far away. |
