# Braillinator

## Description
The Braillinator is a text from image to Braille converter that scans text using a phone camera and translates to braille. The translation is done by pistons that automatically push out of a corresponding physical device, where the user can place their fingers on. These pistons push in and out, spelling out the text in braille, letter by letter, giving the same tactile experience as braille. This physical device also has play through speed adjustments and other controls.
